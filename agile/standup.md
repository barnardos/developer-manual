# Standup

Standup happens every day and includes all team members.

## Format

We currently have standup at 10am. If everyone is present (in the office/via [video call](http://example.com/tbd)) then 
everyone stands up and follows the format of:

- What did you do yesterday? 
- What are you doing today? 
- Are there any blockers?

If any member of the team is not present in the office then standup is done in the 
[#team_yay](https://barnardos.slack.com/messages/G46UGLXF1/) slack channel following the same 3 question format.

## Why

When we share what we're working on we provide the opportunity to ask for help – or have it offered –
before picking up new things to work on. It gives us enough context to know how best to help those around us.

Standup is about shared ownership and self-organisation.

## Flexibility

As with everything else, we can change any aspect of standup through [retrospectives](retrospectives.md).

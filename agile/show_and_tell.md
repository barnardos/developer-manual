# Show and tell

A show and tell happens fortnightly. It includes all of us in the team and people who are affected by what we do. 

Ideally, show and tell should take no longer than 30mins.

## Why do we do show and tell?

- They make our progress transparent and visible to those who care about our work 
- They give us positive feedback and recognition for the hard work we've put in 
- They help our product owner and interested parties set the direction for what's coming next 

## What is show and tell not for?

It's not:

- a status meeting 
- a feature request session

## Format

1. [Hello](#hello)
2. [Show our work](#show-our-work)
3. [Tell our work](#tell-our-work)
4. [Update on next priorities](#update-on-next-priorities)

### Hello

It is really important at the beginning of the meeting to ensure that everyone knows who everyone else is.
Make it clear who's running show and tell and what the format is so that people understand what's going to happen and 
when it's OK to ask questions.

State that each section has a time limit to make sure we keep focus and best use of everyone's time. If someone wants to
talk about something outside of the scope of the show and tell, discuss with the product owner first.

Make it clear that feature requests or requests for estimates aren't part of show and tell.

### Show our work

Where possible/applicable the team member who did the work can show the work. If they don't want to (which is perfectly
fine â€“ we all get stage fright sometimes!) the tech lead can do so. If more than one team member has
contributed to a feature then try to make sure that someone who hasn't demonstrated before has a chance to do so.

A really helpful way to show changes is to show how something used to work and how it works now. Screenshots of the old
system are fine for this.

People who are interested in our work might only be able to see it over video call, so make sure that if this is the
case that the demonstration will work well with those constraints.

### Tell our work

Not every piece of work has a thing to show. That's totally OK. We can demonstrate the value of our 'behind the scenes' 
work with clear examples.

For example: "I've made the test suite twice as fast. It used to take 20 mins to run the tests now it only takes 
10 mins."

Or: "now we've done this, the way is clear for us to do feature X or piece of work Y".

### Update on next priorities

The product owner will:

- give an overview of what'll be the theme of the next chunk of work and tie it into the overall goal or roadmap.
- Thank the team for their work, and everyone else for their time

Now people who wish to stay can request to speak to the product owner about anything that isn't part of show and tell.

# Show and tell

A show and tell is a regular meeting which gives us the opportunity to demonstrate our work.

It can help:

* make our progress visible to those who care about our work
* give us positive feedback and recognition for the hard work we've put in
* our product owner and interested parties set the direction for what's coming next

It's not:

* a status meeting
* a feature request session

## The format of a show and tell

There are four stages:

1. [hello](#hello)
2. [show our work](#show-our-work)
3. [tell our work](#tell-our-work)
4. [update on next priorities](#update-on-next-priorities)

The show and tell should last no longer than 30 minutes.

### Hello

Make sure everyone knows:

* who everyone else is
* who's running the show and tell
* what the format is
* when it's OK to ask questions
* that each section has a time limit
* that feature requests or requests for estimates aren't part of show and tell

### Show our work

The work should be shown by:

* the team member who did the work
* the tech lead if the team member doesn't want to

If more than one team member has contributed to a feature let the person who hasn't demonstrated before do it.

Ideally, show how something used to work and how it works now. You can do this with:

* a quick demo of the old system
* screenshots of the old system

### Tell our work

Not every piece of work has a thing to show. We can demonstrate the value of our 'behind the scenes' work with clear examples.

For example: "I've made the test suite twice as fast. It used to take 20 mins to run the tests now it only takes 10 mins."

Or: "now we've done this, the way is clear for us to do feature X or piece of work Y".

### Update on next priorities

The product owner should:

* give an overview of what'll be the theme of the next chunk of work
* tie this theme into the overall roadmap
* thank the team for their work, and everyone else for their time

Now people who wish to stay can request to speak to the product owner about anything that isn't part of show and tell.

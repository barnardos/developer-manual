# Retrospective

A retrospective, sometimes called a 'retro', is a regular meeting where the whole team talks about what's going well and what isn't.

It gives us the power and responsibility to:

* change what's not working for us
* take ownership of the way we work

We do a retro at the end of a chunk of work (a sprint or a project). However, the content of the retro doesn't have to directly relate to the work done.

We allow 60 to 90 minutes for the meeting.

Retrospectives are the single part of agile that absolutely must happen. They are our most effective tool for improving our way of working.

## The format of a retrospective

There are [many](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Retrospective_Plans) different ways to run a retrospective. It can be helpful to mix it up a bit. Bring a suggestion of an alternative style if you would like to try it. It is ultimately the team's decision what style is chosen, though.

Take it in turns to run a retrospective as it's a valuable reminder that in agile it's about all of us and not individual agendas.

At the start of the retrospective:

* recap any actions from the previous retrospective and whether they were done
* tell everyone what the format of the retrospective is going to be and how long everyone has to write post-it notes for each focus point, e.g. 2 minutes for things that went well, 2 minutes for things that didn't go well
* remind everyone that the retrospective is not for blaming people/shaming any individual
* remind everyone that it's OK to write 'PRIVATE' in the corner of any post-it notes they don't want to appear in the retrospective write up

If any actions remain undone from the previous retrospective, they can be added to the end of this retrospective to discuss why they aren't done and understand what the blocker(s) might be.

Next, ensure everyone has an adequate number of post-it notes and pens. Have a clear and visible timer, and tell people when it's starting.

Once all notes have been written, start with the person to the left of whoever is running the retrospective and go in a clockwise fashion around the team for them to read out their 'sad face' post-it notes. Then go around the team again for them to read out their 'happy face' post-it notes.

After all post-it notes have been read out, encourage discussion to suggest any actions that could be taken to mitigate/improve any of the issues the sad post-it notes have raised. The person running the retro then captures each action and writes it on a post-it and places it visible to the team. Capture any actions to ensure that happy things continue too!

Thank everyone for taking part.

Whoever ran the retrospective gathers up the post-it notes and writes them up.

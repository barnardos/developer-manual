# Retrospectives

A retrospective happens once every two weeks. It is a designated time for us to come together, in a safe space, 
to reflect on how things are going, whether the process working and what, if anything, may need to change.

A retrospective is the single part of agile that absolutely must happen. It is our most effective tool for 
improving our way of working.

## Format

There are [many](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Retrospective_Plans) different ways to run a 
retrospective. The @mnowster method is to ask the team rather than inflict a retrospective style. 
It can be helpful to mix it up a bit so bring a suggestion to an alternative style if you would like but ultimately 
it's the team's decision.

It is worth taking it in turns to run a retrospective as it's a valuable reminder that in agile it's about all of us
and not individual agendas. Yes, it does mean that each retrospective someone misses out on contributing but it also 
has the benefit that it ensures that over time, all our voices are heard.

At the start of the retrospective it's worth saying out loud the following:

- Recap any actions from the previous retrospective and whether they were done. If any remain undone, they can be 
  added to the end of this retrospective to discuss why they aren't done and understand what the 
  blocker(s) might be.
- Tell everyone what the format of the retrospective is going to be and how long everyone has to write 
  sticky notes for each focus point, e.g. 2 minutes for things that went well, 2 minutes for things that didn't 
  go well.
- Remind everyone that retrospective is a safe space and retros are not for blaming people/shaming any individual.
- Remind everyone that it's OK to write 'PRIVATE' in the corner of any stickies they don't want to appear in the 
  retrospective write up.

Next, ensure everyone has adequate number of sticky notes and pens. Have a clear and visible timer, and tell people
when it's starting.

Once all notes have been written, start with the person to the left of whoever is running the retrospective and go in a 
clockwise fashion around the team for them to read out their 'sad face' stickies. Once all the sad stickies have been 
read out, then go around the team again for them to read out their 'happy face' stickies.

After all stickies have been read out, encourage discussion to suggest any actions that could be taken 
to mitigate/improve any of the issues the sad stickies have raised. The person running the retro then captures each 
action and writes it on a sticky and places it visible to the team. Capture any actions to ensure that happy things 
continue too!

Thank everyone for taking part.

Whoever ran the retrospective gathers up the stickies and writes them up in a 
[suitable place](http://example.com/tbd)

## Why

These retros give us the power and responsibility to change what's not working for us.

We all take ownership of the way we work and using our unique skills, help those around us to work in 
a way that is effective, positive, collaborative and constantly improving.

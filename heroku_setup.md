# Heroku setup

We set up Heroku in a consistent way to help us:

* get up to speed quickly
* debug issues effectively

Use:

* your own account for day-to-day tasks
* the Digital Products account for creating new applications or pipelines

## Pipelines

We use [pipelines](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pipelines) to control the flow of our applications from staging to production.

# Creating short URLs

Short URLs help people access our projects. You should use them for projects that are shared internally or externally.

You should use:

* http://dr.barnar.do for internal projects or services
* http://barnar.do for external projects

You'll find the login details for the [URL shortener service](http://app.rebrandly.com/) in the 1Password vault.

# Creating short URLS

For projects we're working on that are being shared internally or externally we should use a short URL to make it easier for people to access the site.

For internal projects or services (like the live-feed to show and tells, for example) we have been using dr.barnar.do (because that joke works internally and is "cute").

For projects that also are externally facing, e.g. might end up as part of the website, we are using barnar.do/project-name

The login details for the [URL shortener service](http://app.rebrandly.com/) is in the 1Password shared vault.

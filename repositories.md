# Repositories

We use repositories (repos) for projects to group:

- source code
- issues
- wikis

## Creating a new repo

When creating a new repo name, you should:

- use lowercase, even for acronyms
- hyphenate between words
- make the name meaningful
- don’t prefix the name with `barnardos-`

## Importing a repo

When importing a repository that was developed by an external organisation:

- remove any Barnardo’s-specific prefix
- if the name has changed, change the repo name to the current name of the app.

# Methodologies

This is a non-exhaustive list of some of the methodologies that we use within the digital team.

[BEM](http://getbem.com/)

> <abbr title="Block Element Modifier">BEM</abbr> is a methodology, that helps you to achieve reusable components and code sharing in the front-end.

[CHANGELOGs](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

> A changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project. The project is often a website or software project, and the changelog usually includes records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, etc. Some open source projects include a changelog as one of the top level files in their distribution.

[Test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

> <abbr title="Test-driven development">TDD</abbr> is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

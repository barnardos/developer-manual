# Team management

We use GitHub's inbuilt team management to control access to our repositories. It provides the level of control we require.

We have three teams:

* `product-developers` – people who actively develop projects for Barnardo's
* `product-managers` – people who manage, test, or have some active involvement in code without being developers
* `product-team` – people in Barnardo's who don't fall into the previous teams

If you are a member of either `product-managers` or `product-developers` you are automatically a member of `product-team`.

Outside of the notion of teams is the notion of _owners_ and _members_. To manage teams you'll need to be an owner. Contact a [current owner](https://github.com/orgs/barnardos/people?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=+role%3Aowner) if you believe you should be one.

## Adding a new person

1. Select the appropriate team [from this list of teams](https://github.com/orgs/barnardos/teams).

3. Select "Add New Member".

## Removing a person

1. Find the appropriate [team member](https://github.com/orgs/barnardos/people).
2. Click the cog.

## Granting a team write access to a project

By default, everyone inside of Barnardo's will have read access to a project.

1. Visit the settings page for the project.
2. Click on "Collaborators & Teams".
3. Click on "Add a team".
4. Select the appropriate team.
5. Select the correct access for the team.

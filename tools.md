[Danger](https://github.com/danger/danger)

> Danger runs after your CI, automating your team's conventions surrounding code review. This provides another logical step in your process, through this Danger can help lint your rote tasks in daily code review. You can use Danger to codify your teams norms, leaving humans to think about code review.

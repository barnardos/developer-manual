# Standup

A standup is a daily meeting to share what we're working on. It provides:

* the opportunity to ask for help â€“ or have it offered
* enough context to know how best to help those around us
* a sense of shared ownership
* the means to self-organise

## The format of a standup

Everyone, in turn, answers the following three questions:

* what did you do yesterday?
* what are you doing today?
* are there any blockers (something that prevents you doing your work)?

That person then nominates the next person to go.

A standup should last no longer than 15 minutes.

If any member of the team is not present (in the office or via video call) then a standup is done in the [#team_yay](https://barnardos.slack.com/messages/C62V1MEUT) slack channel and follows the same 3 question format.

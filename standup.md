# Standup

A standup is a daily text based update to share what we're working on. It provides:

* the opportunity to ask for help â€“ or have it offered
* enough context to know how best to help those around us
* a sense of shared ownership
* the means to self-organise

## The format of a standup

Everyone answers the following three questions:

* what did you do yesterday?
* what are you doing today?
* are there any blockers (something that prevents you doing your work)?

The standup is done in the [Product team private room](https://barnardos.facebook.com/chat/t/1730020383726369) on Workplace.

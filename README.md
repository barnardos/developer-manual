# developer-manual

We use [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) tools and techniques to:

- self-organise and plan
- communicate (within the team and with the rest of the organisation)
- continuously improve the way we work

We follow a loose gathering of agile processes:

- [standups](standup.md)
- [retrospectives](retrospective.md)
- [show and tells](show_and_tell.md)

We can change any aspect of these lightweight processes through retrospectives.

## Contributing code

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to collaborate when writing code. We follow [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), while expanding on:

- [Branches](branches.md)
- [Commits](commits.md)
- [Issues](issues.md)
- [Pull requests](pull-requests.md)
- [Team management](team-management.md)
- [Repositories](repositories.md)

## Deploying code

We use:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for static sites
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com) for sites with a backend code requirement

Ask a member of the team if you need access to these services.

To keep deployments consistent we follow:

- [Heroku setup guide](heroku_setup.md)

When we need a unique URL for our project we follow:

- [Short URL setup guide](short_url.md)

## Tools and methodologies

Within the digital team we use the following:

- [tools](tools.md)
- [methodologies](methodologies.md)

## Setting up developer environment

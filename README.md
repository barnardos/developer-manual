# devs-manual

We use [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) tools and techniques to:

* self-organise and plan
* communicate (within the team and with the rest of the organisation)
* continuously improve the way we work

We follow a loose gathering of agile processes:

* [standups](standup.md)
* [retrospectives](retrospectives.md)
* [show and tells](show_and_tell.md)

We can change any aspect of these lightweight processes through retrospectives.

## Contributing code

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to collaborate when writing code. We follow [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), while expanding on:

* [Branches](branches.md)
* [Commits](commits.md)
* [Pull requests](pull-requests.md)

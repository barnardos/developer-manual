# developer-manual

We use [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) tools and techniques to:

* self-organise and plan
* communicate (within the team and with the rest of the organisation)
* continuously improve the way we work

We follow a loose gathering of agile processes:

* [standups](standup.md)
* [retrospectives](retrospective.md)
* [show and tells](show_and_tell.md)

We can change any aspect of these lightweight processes through retrospectives.

## Contributing code

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to collaborate when writing code. We follow [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), while expanding on:

* [Branches](branches.md)
* [Commits](commits.md)
* [Issues](issues.md)
* [Pull requests](pull-requests.md)
* [Team management](team-management.md)
* [Repositories](repositories.md)

## Deploying code

for Donate and Cookie Banner:

* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for static sites
* [Heroku](https://heroku.com) for sites with a backend code requirement

Ask a member of the team if you need access to these services.

To keep deployments consistent we follow:

* [Heroku setup guide](heroku_setup.md)

When we need a unique URL for our project we follow:

* [Short URL setup guide](short_url.md)

for Website:
* Github, Bitbucket: [wiki](https://github.com/barnardos/website/wiki/Local-Development)

## Tools and methodologies

Within the digital team we use the following:

* [tools](tools.md)
* [methodologies](methodologies.md)
* [dependabot setup instructions](dependabot_setup.md)
* [dependabot PR review instructions](dependabot_pr_review.md)
* [wifi-location-changer setup instructions](wifi-location-changer.md)

## Removing access

When someone leaves the team, [we remove their access to the tools we use](removing_access.md).
